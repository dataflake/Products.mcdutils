mcdutils To-Do's
================

  - (x) Un-hardwire the mapping factory in proxy's 'create' method, to allow
        other kinds of data to be stored.

  - (x) Fix the pickling of mappings *correctly*, instead of requiring that
        the proxy pick out the 'data' member.

  - (x) Expand the proxy's API to support use cases needed by a
        RAMCacheManager workalike.

  - (_) Implement a RAMCacheManager workalike.

  - (_) Investigate using a memcached proxy instead of the ZEO disk cache.

  - (_) Modify the proxy to allow use of a global utility which manages
        the pool of servers.

  - (_) Add support for defining the server pool utility via ZCML.
